## Methodology

The methodology used for the development of the application was based on the Startup Kaizen (continuous improvement), object of study from Nathalia Novaes Leonessa (www.startupsorocaba.com.br)

The Startup Kaizen methodology consisted of four phases at each iteration (MVP's):
- Requirements:
	* What is the MVP? How to Validate? What is the business value? Customers? How to make money?
	* Groming, User Stories Survey + key moments = People
- Validation:
	* Which stories have been validated?
	* What impact on the customer?
	* Development prioritization
- Project:
	* How will stories be developed?
	* What are the key activities, resources and partnerships of your startup?
- Implementation:
	* How many bugs were found?
	* How many stories have been tested?
	* How many bugs have been fixed?
